        <section id="Myself"><h4 >About Myself</h4>
            <img width="10%" src="me.jpg" alt="">
            <p >
                A professor once asked in class, "Tell me something interesting about yourself." I thought long and hard, trying to come up with something intriguing that wasn't related to my university lifeâ€”just something interesting and unique about me.
            That's when it hit me: I'm just a girl with nothing particularly extraordinary to share. So, to break the suspense, here's my short introduction.</p>
            <p >My name is Maimouna Akhter Tonny, and I'm a proud Bangladeshi . However, here's something a bit unusualâ€”I've hardly ever been to my home country. I was born and raised in Qatar, and for all my 20-something years, this country is all I knew mostly. Strangely enough, despite growing up here, my knowledge of Arabic is, much to everyone's (including my own) disappointment, quite limited.
            Now, let me share a bit about my interests. I love reading, painting, exploring new places, and trying new foods.My favorite animal is Owl ðŸ’—. I'm passionate about learning and embracing new cultures, and I never pass up the chance to volunteer when the opportunity arises.
            Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little better! ðŸ˜Š </p>

                    <h5><u> Major</u></h5>
                    <p>
                        I am currently pursuing a <a href="https://www.qu.edu.qa/en-us/Colleges/engineering/academics/computer/cs/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> major at <a href="https://www.qu.edu.qa/en-us/" target="_blank">Qatar University</a>, an ABET-accredited program requiring 120 credit hours. My passion for Computer Science started during high school, where I attended related workshops. I was proud to achieve the highest grade in my IT course during my senior year, topping my class in the final exam.

                    <h5><u>Minor</u> </h5>
                    <p>
                      I am pursuing a minor in <a href="https://www.qu.edu.qa/en-us/Colleges/engineering/academics/civil/Pages/Minor-in-Engineering-Project-Management.aspx" target="_blank">Engineering Project Management</a>, which requires the completion of at least 18 credit hours. Although balancing the minor with my demanding major has added some workload, it provides a refreshing change and an opportunity to collaborate with peers from other engineering disciplines. I believe this minor will not only enhance my skills but also contribute to my future career prospects.
